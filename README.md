- Delegates work to appropriate specialized agents
- Manages complex multi-step processes
- Handles parameter passing between agents

**Input:** High-level user request

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Each agent is defined in a standardized JSON format specifying:
- Unique identifier name
- Input parameters and their types
- Output structure
- Working examples

To use these agents in your application:

```javascript
// Example of using the summarize agent

  content: "During our quarterly planning meeting, we discussed..."
});

console.log(result); // Returns a concise summary
```

## ðŸ”„ Integration Examples

The agents can work together to solve complex tasks:

```javascript
// Example: Research and report generation workflow
const supervisorResult = await invokeAgent("supervisor_agent", {
  user_request: "Create a report about meditation techniques for anxiety management"
});

// Supervisor will delegate to search_agent and report_agent as needed
```
